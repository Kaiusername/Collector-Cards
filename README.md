If you are having trouble finding them, you can refer to the mods documentation spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HSBNqhs5jxpzkb7dSoIKIEcEhsx_uTQTDQfCk_Y2_8/edit?usp=sharing

Cards will only spawn if you have not visited their respective regions, a workaround includes spawning them in via the 'Console Command' mod.

Future plans include additional cards and packs, visual reworks of pre-existing cards, and distinct icons to add uniqueness to cards that are part of a collection.
Special thanks to TKG for the original implementation, and Deadman for his tutorials.

Known Issues: Mod will not be able to be translated into other languages until a later update.
